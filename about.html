        <p>
          This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Very clean and
          the workers here are very kind and they make sure that you are having
          a good time. I never realized that the hotel had a underground
          Aquarium, when I saw it I was amazed of how beautiful it looks. So
          many different sea creatures there which was relaxing to watch.
          Overall my favorite part was the rooms which had a big kitchen and a
          king size bed with a very soft mattress. I will for sure comeback
          someday. Can't Wait!

          The minute I walked into this hotel I felt welcomed. I really enjoyed
          the resort and the underground Aquarium. My kids and husband had a
          blast at the resort which was huge and very nice. I also loved the
          food which was amazing. Breakfast, Lunch, and dinner were free and
          basically a all you can eat buffet which was awesome. I will be back
          someday and I know my experience will be even better than last time
